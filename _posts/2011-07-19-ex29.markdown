# Exercise 29: What If

Here is the next script of Ruby you will enter, which introduces you to the `if-statement`. Type this in, make it run exactly right, and then we'll try see if your practice has paid off.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
people = 20
cats = 30
dogs = 15

if people < cats
  puts "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"
end

if people > cats
  puts "Not many cats! The world is saved!"
end

if people < dogs
  puts "The world is drooled on!"
end

if people > dogs
  puts "The world is dry!"
end

dogs += 5

if people >= dogs
  puts "People are greater than or equal to dogs."
end

if people <= dogs
  puts "People are less than or equal to dogs."
end

if people == dogs
  puts "People are dogs."
end
{% endhighlight %}
## What You Should See

    $ ruby ex29.rb 
    Too many cats! The world is doomed!
    The world is dry!
    People are greater than or equal to dogs.
    People are less than or equal to dogs.
    People are dogs.
    $

## Extra Credit
In this extra credit, try to guess what you think the `if-statement` is and what it does. Try to answer these questions in your own words before moving onto the next exercise:

1. What do you think the `if` does to the code under it?
2. Can you put other boolean expressions from Ex. 27 in the `if-statement`? Try it.
3. What happens if you change the initial variables for people, cats, and dogs?
